	- socket (bouquin jm rifflet)
	- multiplexing (epoll ou select)
	- desgin oop for the project
	- configuration file : what is accepted? cf. nginx.conf

-----------------------
Drafts implementations:
-----------------------
	- server nginx on a good/portable environnement for testing (at home + 42dump)
	- creation and simple communication via sockets
	- trying to multiplex sockets via poll, select etc
	- persistent connection (==keep-alive) vs pipeling and domain sharding (both not to implemnt?) 
	- parsing from the server : 
		- request line (method+uri+version)
			- only rq error (bad method/version, ie. not file presence for get or body for post, uri checked by cgi?)
			--> use of exceptions to deal with errors? (bad method, version, lack of body) Could be status code? but what for good ones?
			--> or return a state : the status code or the work to do
		- header : 
			- dealt at server not only cgi (for basic ones?)
			- mandatory ones? ie: content lenght for POST should be check here or at cgi
			- i think some are ignored (extra entry? see nginx)
			- detect (some) errors from key value here?
			- nginx tests needed!!
		- whole message parsing from the server (ie. reject, is there a body)
	- Creating the response :
		- if error on rq line: read exception or status code returned to create the satus line
		- if header error: nsp
		- if body/lack of: nsp
		- GET: send to cgi (that would check everything?)
		- POST: if body ok --> send to cgi 
		- DELETE: permisison to be checked here or at cgi?
